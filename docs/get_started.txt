Getting Started
===============

This short tutorial shows how configure and run a 5 nodes SGE cluster in the Amazon public clouds. 

In this tutorial it is assumed that you have a knowledge of the basic *SGE* commands. The description
of the *SGE* resource manager is out of the scope of this manual. 


1. Download the *Blow* executable distribution
----------------------------------------------

The lastest *Blow* executable distribution is available at `this link`_. Download and 
save it somewhere to your machine. 

If you a running a \*nix system (Linux, Mac OS X, etc.) give the execute permission 
to the download *JAR* file, using the following command::

  # chmod +x blow.jar 
  
  

.. _`this link`: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/376524/blow/blow.jar


2. The configuration file
--------------------------------

Create a file named ``blow.conf`` with the content showed below. Save it in the same directory 
where the ``blow.jar`` was downloaded. ::


  blow_simple_cluster {
    access-key = <replace with your AWS access key>
    secret-key = <replace with your AWS secret key>
    region-id = us-east-1
    zone-id = us-east-1b
    image-id = ami-e565ba8c		
    instance-type = t1.micro
    size = 5

    plugin = [
      hosts
      {nfs { path: /soft }}
      {nfs { path: /scratch }}
      {sge { root: /soft/sge6 } }
    ]
  }


This configuration will deploy a cluster made up of file nodes. It uses the Amazon Linux AMI 2012.03 (x86_64) with ID ``ami-e565ba8c``. 

It installs the SGE resource manager in the shared path ``/soft/sge6`` and a second shared path named ``/scratch`` is created.


3. Launch the cluster 
---------------------

The *Blow* command needs to be executed using the command line interface. It has the following syntax::

  blow.jar [blow options] <cluster name> [command name [command parameters] ] 

If the *command* is omitted it will run in the *interactive* mode, waiting for a command to be executed. 

.. note::
  Windows users need to launch the *Blow* application with the *Java* interpreter. So the above syntax must be replaced 
  as follows::
  
    java -jar blow.jar [blow options] <cluster name> [command name [command parameters] ]
     

For the sake of this example start *Blow* in the interactive mode. Open a terminal window, 
move to the directory where the configuration file and the blow executable have been saved and 
specify the following command::

  # ./blow.jar blow_simple_cluster
  
If a SSH key-pair cannot be found in the current directory or in the ``$HOME/.ssh/`` path it will prompt to create a new key pair.
Answer ``y`` and press enter to proceed. 

When done you will get the *Blow* prompt as showed below::

     ___  __
    / _ )/ /__ _    __
   / _  / / _ \ |/|/ /
  /____/_/\___/__,__/  ver: 0.5

  blow [blow_simple_cluster] $ 

Before launch the cluster you may verify its configuration entering the ``conf`` command on the *Blow* prompt. 
It will result something similar to the output showed below::

  blow [blow_simple_cluster] $ conf
  cluster: blow_simple_cluster
  user-name: your-user-name
  private-key: ./id_rsa
  public-key: ./id_rsa.pub
  access-key: AKIAIF3TUNLSJYG5UWQQ
  region-id: us-east-1
  zone-id: us-east-1b
  image-id: ami-e565ba8c
  instance-type: t1.micro
  size: 5

When ready, launch the cluster entering the command ``start``::


  blow [blow_simple_cluster] $ start
  
  
It will take some minutes to launch the virtual machines, configure them and install the SGE daemons. When it will complete
your screen will show something similar the following output::

  blow [blow_simple_cluster] $ start
  ~ Creating cluster: blow_simple_cluster
  ~ Creating the 'master' node
  ~ Creating 4 worker node(s)
  ~ Configuring hosts file
  ~ Configuring NFS file system
  ~ Configuring NFS file system
  ~ Configuring OpenGridEngine (SGE)
  blow [blow_simple_cluster] $ 


.. attention::
  If the following message is displayed:

  ``WARN: Disabling high-strength ciphers: cipher strengths apparently limited by JCE policy``

  you will need to install the *Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)* for high-strength ciphers.
  This is not included by default due to US export restrictions. This is available in the `Java download`_ at
  the bottom of the page.

4. Access the remote master node
--------------------------------

Use the command ``listnodes`` on the *Blow* prompt to get the list of all running launched nodes in the cluster. 
You will get a list similar to the one showed below:: 

  blow [blow_simple_cluster] $ listnodes 
  i-ddd162bb;   23.20.217.171; RUNNING; blow_simple_cluster; master
  i-5fd76439;     23.22.43.58; RUNNING; blow_simple_cluster; worker
  i-5dd7643b;     23.22.63.20; RUNNING; blow_simple_cluster; worker
  i-5bd7643d;    23.20.28.196; RUNNING; blow_simple_cluster; worker
  i-59d7643f;    23.20.152.41; RUNNING; blow_simple_cluster; worker


Any nodes is accesible using a SSH client. *Blow* comes with an integrated SSH client.
To connect to a remote node on the prompt just enter the ``ssh`` command followed by the IP 
address of the node you want to access::

  ssh 23.20.217.171

.. attention::
  The integrated SSH client manages automatically the access credentials. Using a different 
  SSH client you will need to specify the user name and identity file (the private key).  
  
When connected to the remote node, you may want to verify that the *SGE* scheduler has been 
correctly installed. At the shell prompt of the remote system enter the command ``qhost``.
It should print a list of similar to the one showed below::

  [domU-12-31-38-04-10-03 ~]$ qhost
  HOSTNAME                ARCH         NCPU  LOAD  MEMTOT  MEMUSE  SWAPTO  SWAPUS
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  global                  -               -     -       -       -       -       -
  domU-12-31-38-04-10-03  linux-x64       1  0.03  595.4M   49.8M     0.0     0.0
  domU-12-31-38-07-4E-06  linux-x64       1  0.04  595.4M   42.8M     0.0     0.0
  ip-10-122-83-78         linux-x64       1  0.51  595.4M   50.8M     0.0     0.0
  ip-10-122-98-108        linux-x64       1  0.03  595.4M   42.9M     0.0     0.0
  ip-10-124-215-153       linux-x64       1  0.03  595.4M   42.8M     0.0     0.0
  

  
5. Run a simple job and terminate the cluster  
---------------------------------------------

Move to the ``/scratch`` folder, create a the job script and submit it to the *SGE* for the execution. 
For the sake of this tutorial, you could run these commands::

  cd /scratch 
  echo "Hello world!" > test.sh 
  qsub -cwd -sync y test.sh 
  

When the *SGE* complete the execution of the submitted job, your find the following content in the 
current directory::

  $ ls -la 
  total 16
  drwxr-xr-x  2 ec2-user wheel 4096 May 11 14:15 .
  dr-xr-xr-x 26 root     root  4096 May 11 13:59 ..
  -rw-r--r--  1 ec2-user wheel   19 May 11 14:14 test.sh
  -rw-r--r--  1 ec2-user wheel    0 May 11 14:15 test.sh.e1
  -rw-r--r--  1 ec2-user wheel   97 May 11 14:15 test.sh.o1

6. Terminate the cluster session
--------------------------------

When you have done, don't forget to shutdown the cluster and all the running instances. 

Log out from the remote node using the ``exit`` command and stop the cluster entering the command ``terminate`` 
on the *Blow* prompt.
