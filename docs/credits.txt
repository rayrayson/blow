  If I have seen farther than others, it is because I was standing on the shoulders of giants.
  -- Albert Einstein


*Blow* was made possible to the open source community and in particular the following OSS projects:

  * `Groovy`_ -- The scripting language that put the fun back into Java programming
  * `JClouds`_ -- It manages the cloud connection for Amazon AWS as well as for many other providers
  * `Typesafe Config`_ -- Used to handle the application configuration files
  * `SSHJ`_ -- A pure Java SSH client implementation
  * `Spock Framework`_ -- Unit testing made simple
  * `Fast Data Transfer`_ - FDT is an Application for Efficient Data Transfers developed at CERN.
