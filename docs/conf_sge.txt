Open Grid Engine (SGE) configuration
====================================

Open Grid Scheduler/Grid Engine is a free and open-source batch-queuing system for distributed resource management. 
OGS/GE is based on the Sun Grid Engine, and maintained by the same group of external (i.e. non-Sun) developers
who started contributing code since 2001.

This page explain how install and configure automatically a *SGE* instance in a cluster managed by *Blow*.

Basic SGE configuration
-----------------------

The SGE configuration requires the operation ``sge`` to be added in the ``operations`` attribute
in the cluster configuration file. 

Currently it is required to install the *SGE* binary files in a directory shared by all nodes in the clusters.
This directory has to be defined by the parameter ``path`` for the ``sge`` operation definition.
For example::

  mycluster {
  
    imageId: 'ami-xxx'
    :
    operations {
        nfs(path: '/soft')
        sge(path: '/soft/sge6')

    }

  }

In the above example, it is installed a shared directory named ``/soft``. The *SGE* is installed in the sub-directory 
``/soft/sge6``, moreover the ``sge`` operation starts the required daemon(s) both on the master node and the workers nodes
as well as configure the environment variables.

When the installation complete, you will able to log-in in any remote node using a SSH client and verify
that the *SGE* installation process has been completed successfully with the command ``qhost``. It will display 
the list of all running *SGE* nodes. 


Local spool directory
---------------------

The spool directory for each SGE daemons is the greatest source of NFS traffic for Grid Engine.

By configuring local spool directories, all that traffic can be redirected to the local disk on each compute host,
thus isolating it from the rest of the network as well as reducing the I/O latency.

Using *Blow* the SGE spool directory can be specified by simply providing the ``spool`` parameter in the ``sge`` operation
definition. For example::


  mycluster {

    imageId: 'ami-xxx'
    :
    operations {
        nfs(path: '/soft')
        sge(path: '/soft/sge6', spool: '/var/spool/sge')
    }
  }

SGE configuration attributes
----------------------------

* ``path`` (\*): The root directory where the *SGE* binary files will be installed. It must be a shared
  directory accessible by all the nodes in the cluster.

* ``cell``: The name of the *SGE* instance. Default value ``default``.

* ``clusterName``: The name for the cluster installation. If it is not specified, the value ``cloud_sge``
  will used by default.

* ``installationMode``: The type of installation. The following values can be used: ``compile`` compiles the SGE binaries,
  install it, and configure the daemons and clients on each node; ``deploy``: install a pre-compiled version of the
  SGE binaries and configure it; ``config``: just configure the SGE daemons, the SGE binaries should be available in the specified ``path`` parameter.
* ``execdPort``: The *TCP* port required by the *SGE* ``execd`` daemon. Default value ``6445``.

* ``qmasterPort``: The *TCP* port used by the *SGE* qmaster daemon. Default value ``6444``.

* ``adminEmail``: The email address used by the *SGE* to send notification. Default value ``none@none.edue``

* ``spool``: The SGE spool directory, by default is used directory ``$path/$cell/spool``

* ``temp``: The temporary path used during the installation process. If it is not specified, the path ``/tmp``
  will used by default.
