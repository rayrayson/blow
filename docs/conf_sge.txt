Open Grid Engine (SGE) configuration
====================================

Open Grid Scheduler/Grid Engine is a free and open-source batch-queuing system for distributed resource management. 
OGS/GE is based on the Sun Grid Engine, and maintained by the same group of external (i.e. non-Sun) developers
who started contributing code since 2001.

This page explain how install and configure automatically a *SGE* instance in a cluster managed by *Blow*.

A full description of the *SGE* installation and configuration procedure is out of the scope of this manual.

Basic SGE configuration
-----------------------


The SGE configuration requires the plugin ``sge`` to be added in the ``plugin`` attribute 
in the cluster configuration file. 

Currently is it required to install the *SGE* binary files in a directory shared by all nodes in the clusters. 
This directory is the defined as the ``root`` installation directory and it needs to be specified as an attribute 
in the ``sge`` plugin configuration. For example::

  my_cluster {
  
    image-id: ami_xxx
    :
    plugin [
      hosts
      {nfs { path: /soft }}
      {sge { root: /soft/sge6 } }
    ]
  }

In the above example, it is installed a shared directory named ``/soft``. The *SGE* is installed in the sub-directory 
``/soft/sge6``, moreover the ``sge`` plugin starts the required daemon(s) both on the master node and the workers nodes 
as well as configure the environment variables.

When the installation complete, wou will able to log-in in any remote node using a SSH client and verify 
that the *SGE* installation process has been completed successfully with the command ``qhost``. It will display 
the list of all running *SGE* nodes. 



SGE configuration attributes
----------------------------

* ``root`` (\*): The root directory where the *SGE* binary files will be installed. It must be a shared 
  directory accessible by all the nodes in the cluster.

* ``installation-mode``: The type of installation

* ``tmp``: The temporary path used during the installation process. If it is not specified, the path ``/tmp``
  will used by default.

* ``cluster-name``: The name for the cluster installation. If it is not specified, the value ``cloud_sge``
  will used by default.

* ``qmaster-port``: The *TCP* port used by the *SGE* qmaster daemon. Default value ``6444``.

* ``execd-port``: The *TCP* port required by the *SGE* ``execd`` daemon. Default value ``6445``.

* ``cell``: The name of the *SGE* instance. Default value ``default``.

* ``admin-email``: The email address used by the *SGE* to send notification. Default value ``none@none.edue``
