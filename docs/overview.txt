Overview
========

*Blow* is an open source free toolkit created to simplify the process of configuring and deploying
clusters of virtual machines in public clouds. 

The cluster properties are specified in a simple configuration file. *Blow* manages automatically 
the various installation tasks, making the overall process faster, safer and replicable.

*Blow* has been designed to be an open and easily extensible framework. Users can implement 
their own plugins to support special requirements and custom use-cases. 

It currently supports the Amazon AWS cloud services, but in future releases, it aims to support
more public cloud providers.
