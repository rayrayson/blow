GlusterFS file system configuration
===================================

*GlusterFS* is an open source, clustered file system capable of scaling to several petabytes and handling thousands of
clients. It could be a valid and more alternative the the standard Linux *NFS*.

*GlusterFS* server can be configured to work in different modality, supporting complex file system organization.

Currently *Blow* comes with a basic support for the GlusterFS file system and is able to install and configure a single
server running a volume on the instance ephemeral storage or alternatively to an attached EBS volume.

The GlusterFS operation
-----------------------

The GlusterFS setup is carried out by the *operation* named ``glusterfs``. This operation has to be added to
the ``operations`` attribute in the cluster definition. It creates and starts a Gluster *volume* on the *master* node
in the configured cluster. It also starts the Gluster server and export the volume using the *path* specified with the ``path``
attribute in the *operation* configuration. For example::

  MyCluster {
    imageId: '..'
    :
    operations {
        glusterfs(path: '/scratch')
    }

  }


The above declaration creates the ``/scratch`` directory in the master node, start the Gluster daemon
and export that folder to the client nodes. Also it will create the same directory on all the client nodes
and mount the network shared folder.  

It is possible to share more than one Gluster volume by simply repeating the ``glusterfs`` entry as many times as the
volumes are to be exported.

For example:: 

  MyCluster {
    imageId: '..'
    :
    operations {
      glusterfs( path: '/scratch'  )
      glusterfs( path: '/data' )
    }
  }
