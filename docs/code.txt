Getting the code 
================

The *Blow* framework source code is hosted on Github at the following link:https://github.com/paoloditommaso/blow .

You can download the code with the following command::

  git clone git@github.com:paoloditommaso/blow.git


Build from sources
------------------

The build procedure has the following dependencies:

* Java JDK 6 or higher.
* Groovy 1.8.6 or higher.
* Make sure the variable ``GROOVY_HOME`` is defined.

The build script is written using the Groovy language and uses the Ant Builder feature to build the project.
All the required dependencies are defined in the Maven ``pom.xml`` file, and all the required libraries will
be download automatically by the script, using the included Maven Ant task integration plugin.

Launch the build script by running the following command in the project root folder::

  groovy ./build.groovy
  
The build script creates the self-contained executable JAR package by default.

The following targets can be provided optionally on the build script command line:

* ``info``: Print out the build variables.
* ``clean``: Remove all temporary files in the build folder.
* ``compile``: Compile all the sources.
* ``run``: Launch the application shell (useful to test changes in the sources).
* ``pack``: Create the big distribution jar package.
* ``all`` (default)


Development status
------------------
Blow is in early stages of development. It has been tested with the Amazon Linux 2012.03 (x86_64) public ami (ami-e565ba8c).
It may not work properly using different Linux distribution/ami.

Our commitment is to support the most commonly used Linux distributions (RedHat, Ubuntu and Suse) in future releases.
