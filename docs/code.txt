The build procedure has the following dependencies:

* Java JDK 6 or higher version 
* Groovy 1.8.6 or higher version.
* Make sure the variable ``GROOVY_HOME`` is defined.

* ``clean``: Remove all temporary files in the build folder.
* ``compile``: Compile all the sources.
* ``run``: Launch the application shell (useful to test changes in the sources).
* ``pack``: Create the big distribution jar package.
